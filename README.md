## Diabetes Preiction Using ML Support Vector Classifier
Data is in comma seperated value (csv)
# Aim : Create a model using machine learning algorithm to predict whether the patient have diabetis or not

This senario seems like a binary classification problem 

Model : SVC 

####  - To Identifying the most relevant features for separating the classes (diabetic and non-diabetic).
####  - To perform well even with limited data compared to some other algorithms. Because focus on finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the classes.
#### - Non-linearity Handling: 
##### The capability of the algorithm to deal with situations where the data cannot be perfectly separated by a straight line (hyperplane) in the original feature space.
##### He factors affecting diabetes might not have a simple linear correlation. In such scenarios, a straight line cannot perfectly divide the data points belonging to different classes.
